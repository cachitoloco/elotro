🎯 EXAMPLE WORKFLOW:

1. INITIAL BUY: WLD→YIELD at 1.0 WLD per token
   📊 Average Price: 1.0 WLD per token
   🎯 Profit Target (15%): 1.15 WLD per token

2. PRICE DROPS TO 0.85 (15% DIP detected):
   ✅ BUYS more (0.85 < 1.0 average)
   📊 New Average: ~0.92 WLD per token
   🎯 New Target: ~1.06 WLD per token

3. PRICE RISES TO 1.1:
   ❌ DOESN'T BUY (1.1 > 0.92 average)
   ⏳ Holds positions and waits
