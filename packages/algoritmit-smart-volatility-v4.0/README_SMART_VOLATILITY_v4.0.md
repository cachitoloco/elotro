## 🧠 How Smart Volatility Works

### 📊 Volatility Detection

The system analyzes recent price movements to classify market conditions:

- **Low Volatility**: <20% moves, <10% average volatility
- **Normal Volatility**: 20-50% moves, 10-25% average volatility
- **High Volatility**: 50-100% moves, 25-50% average volatility
- **Extreme Volatility**: >100% moves, >50% average volatility

### 🎯 Adaptive Thresholds

Based on volatility, the system automatically adjusts:

**DIP Buying Thresholds:**
```
Low Vol:    7.5% → 15% → 22.5% → 30%
Normal Vol: 15% → 30% → 45% → 60%
High Vol:   22.5% → 45% → 67.5% → 90%
Extreme Vol: 30% → 60% → 90% → 120%
```

**Profit Taking Thresholds:**
```
Low Vol:    30% → 70% → 150% → 300% → 500%
Normal Vol: 50% → 100% → 200% → 500% → 1000%
High Vol:   70% → 150% → 300% → 700% → 1500%
