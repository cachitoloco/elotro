# 🚀 HoldStation SDK Integration Guide

## Overview

The WorldChain Trading Bot now integrates with **HoldStation SDK** for optimal trading on Worldchain. This provides access to HoldStation's DEX infrastructure (HoldSo, ZeroX) instead of relying solely on Uniswap V3.

## Why HoldStation SDK?

- ✅ **Native Worldchain Support**: Built specifically for Worldchain
- ✅ **Better Liquidity**: Access to HoldStation's DEX ecosystem
- ✅ **Proven Success**: Used by sinclave.js for successful trading
- ✅ **WLD/ORO Pairs**: Proper support for Worldchain token pairs
- ✅ **Advanced Routing**: Optimal price discovery and execution

## Installation

### Automatic Installation (Recommended)

The HoldStation SDK is automatically installed when you use our installation scripts:

```bash
# For Corit Professional Edition
./corit-install.sh

# For Novice Edition  
./auto-install.sh
```

### Manual Installation

If you need to install HoldStation SDK manually:

```bash
# Run our dedicated installation script
./install-holdstation-sdk.sh

# Or install manually
npm install @holdstation/worldchain-sdk@latest
npm install @holdstation/worldchain-ethers-v6@latest
```

## How It Works

### 1. Sinclave Enhanced Trade

The bot now includes a **"Sinclave Enhanced Trade"** option that:

- 🔄 **Tries HoldStation SDK first** for optimal routing
- 🔄 **Falls back to Uniswap V3** if HoldStation unavailable
- 📊 **Shows which system was used** in the results

### 2. Trading Flow

3. 📊 View Trading Pairs
4. 🔍 Check Pair Liquidity
5. 💡 Suggest Valid Trading Pairs
```

## Supported Trading Pairs

With HoldStation SDK, these pairs should work:

- ✅ **WLD/ORO** - Primary trading pair from sinclave.js
- ✅ **WLD/WETH** - If liquidity exists
- ✅ **WLD/USDC** - Stablecoin pairs
- ✅ **Other Worldchain tokens** with HoldStation liquidity

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "HoldStation SDK unavailable"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Install HoldStation SDK
./install-holdstation-sdk.sh

# Or manually
npm install @holdstation/worldchain-sdk@latest
npm install @holdstation/worldchain-ethers-v6@latest
```

### Issue: "HoldStation SDK returned no quote"

**Possible causes:**
- Token pair doesn't exist on HoldStation DEX
- Insufficient liquidity for the amount
- Invalid token addresses

**Solution:**
- Use "Suggest Valid Trading Pairs" to find working pairs
- Try smaller amounts
- Verify token addresses

### Issue: Trading still fails

**Fallback options:**
- The bot automatically falls back to Uniswap V3
- Use "Check Pair Liquidity" to verify pair exists
- Try different token pairs

## Configuration

### Partner Code

The bot automatically sets a partner code:
```javascript
setPartnerCode("WORLDCHAIN_TRADING_BOT_2025");
```

### Slippage and Fees

Default settings optimized for Worldchain:
```javascript
const params = {
    slippage: "0.5",  // 0.5% slippage tolerance
    fee: "0.2",       // 0.2% fee
    // ... other params
};
```

## Benefits
