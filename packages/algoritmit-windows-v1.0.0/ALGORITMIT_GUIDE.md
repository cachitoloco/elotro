# ü§ñ ALGORITMIT Machine Learning Trading Strategy

## Overview

ALGORITMIT is an advanced machine learning-powered trading strategy that learns from market patterns and automatically executes trades based on AI predictions. It combines multiple ML algorithms with technical analysis to make intelligent trading decisions.

## üß† How It Works

### Machine Learning Components

1. **Linear Regression Model**: Predicts future price movements based on historical trends
2. **Pattern Recognition**: Identifies bullish, bearish, and neutral market patterns
3. **Moving Average Analysis**: Tracks short and long-term price trends
4. **Volatility Analysis**: Measures market volatility for risk assessment
5. **Feature Extraction**: Converts raw price data into meaningful ML features

### Learning Process

1. **Data Collection**: Continuously monitors price movements every minute
2. **Feature Engineering**: Extracts technical indicators (SMA, volatility, trend strength)
3. **Pattern Classification**: Categorizes market behavior as bullish/bearish/neutral
4. **Model Training**: Updates ML models with new market data
5. **Prediction**: Combines multiple signals for trading decisions

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Step 1: Enable ALGORITMIT

1. Go to Main Menu ‚Üí Option 7 (ü§ñ ALGORITMIT)
2. Select "1. Enable/Disable ALGORITMIT"
3. Choose "y" to enable

### Step 2: Configure Learning Mode

1. Select "2. Configure Learning Mode"
2. Enable Learning Mode to start data collection
3. Let it run for at least 24 hours to gather sufficient data

### Step 3: Monitor ML Statistics

1. Select "4. View ML Statistics" to track:
   - ML Accuracy percentage
   - Training data points collected
   - Model performance metrics

### Step 4: Enable Auto-Trading (Optional)

‚ö†Ô∏è **WARNING**: This executes real trades with real money!

1. Select "3. Configure Auto-Trading Mode"
2. Type "CONFIRM" when prompted
3. Start with small position sizes (0.01-0.1 WLD)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Parameters

### Confidence Threshold (50-95%)
- **70%+**: High confidence, more trades
- **80%+**: Very high confidence, fewer but better trades  
- **90%+**: Extremely selective, rare but high-quality trades

### Max Position Size (0.01-10 WLD)
- Maximum amount of WLD to risk per trade
- Start small and increase based on performance

### Risk Tolerance (1-20%)
- Percentage of position size to adjust based on risk
- Lower = more conservative, Higher = more aggressive

### Learning Period (50-500 data points)
- Number of historical data points to use for training
- More data = better accuracy but slower adaptation

### Prediction Window (1-60 minutes)
- How far ahead the model predicts
- Shorter = more responsive, Longer = more stable

## üìä Understanding Statistics

### ML Accuracy Interpretation
- **70%+**: üü¢ Excellent - High confidence predictions
- **50-69%**: üü° Good - Moderate confidence predictions  
- **<50%**: üî¥ Poor - Needs more training data

### Trading Performance
- **Win Rate 60%+**: üü¢ Strong performance
- **Win Rate 40-59%**: üü° Moderate performance
- **Win Rate <40%**: üî¥ Weak - Adjust parameters

## üéØ Trading Signals

### Buy Signals Generated When:
- Price prediction shows upward trend
- Bullish pattern recognized with high confidence
- Current price below moving averages (oversold)
- Low volatility suggests stability

### Sell Signals Generated When:
- Price prediction shows downward trend  
- Bearish pattern recognized with high confidence
- Current price above moving averages (overbought)
- High volatility suggests instability

## üõ°Ô∏è Risk Management

### Automatic Risk Controls
1. **Position Sizing**: Based on confidence and risk tolerance
2. **Confidence Filtering**: Only trades above threshold confidence
3. **Volatility Adjustment**: Reduces position size in volatile markets
4. **Pattern Validation**: Requires multiple confirming signals

### Manual Risk Controls
1. **Start Small**: Begin with 0.01-0.1 WLD positions
2. **Monitor Performance**: Check statistics regularly
3. **Adjust Parameters**: Fine-tune based on results
4. **Disable if Needed**: Stop auto-trading anytime

## üîÑ Model Retraining

### Automatic Retraining
- Models retrain every 24 hours automatically
- Uses latest market data to improve accuracy
- Adapts to changing market conditions

### Manual Retraining
- Force retraining anytime via menu option 7
- Useful after major market events
- Helps improve model performance

## üìà Best Practices

### Phase 1: Learning (Days 1-7)
1. Enable ALGORITMIT with Learning Mode only
2. Let it collect data for at least 24-48 hours
3. Monitor ML accuracy development
4. Do NOT enable auto-trading yet

### Phase 2: Testing (Days 8-14)  
1. Enable auto-trading with minimum position size (0.01 WLD)
2. Set high confidence threshold (80-85%)
3. Monitor every trade and performance
4. Adjust parameters based on results

### Phase 3: Scaling (Days 15+)
1. Gradually increase position sizes if profitable
2. Lower confidence threshold if accuracy is high
3. Let the system run autonomously
4. Check statistics weekly

## üö® Important Warnings

### Financial Risks
- **Real Money**: Auto-trading uses real WLD tokens
- **No Guarantees**: ML predictions can be wrong
- **Market Volatility**: Crypto markets are highly volatile
- **Start Small**: Always begin with minimal amounts

### Technical Limitations
- **Learning Period**: Needs time to collect data
- **Market Changes**: Models may lag during regime changes
- **Overfitting**: Too much historical data can hurt performance
- **False Signals**: No ML system is 100% accurate

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Low ML Accuracy
- **Solution**: Let it learn longer (48+ hours)
- **Check**: Ensure price database is running
- **Verify**: Sufficient discovered tokens for analysis

### No Auto-Trades Executing
- **Check**: Confidence threshold not too high
- **Verify**: Auto-trading mode enabled
- **Confirm**: Sufficient WLD balance in wallet
- **Review**: Recent ML predictions in statistics

### Poor Trading Performance
- **Lower**: Confidence threshold for more selective trades
- **Reduce**: Position sizes to limit losses
- **Increase**: Risk tolerance if being too conservative
- **Wait**: Allow more learning time

## üìö Advanced Features
