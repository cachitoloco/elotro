## 🧠 **How Smart Volatility Helps Beginners**

### **🎯 Automatic Adaptation:**
Instead of you having to figure out market conditions, the AI does it for you:

**Normal Market (Low Volatility):**
- 15% dip → Small buy (0.05 WLD)
- 5% profit target → Sells at exactly 5%

**Volatile Market (High Volatility):**
- 30% dip → Medium buy (0.1 WLD)
- 60% dip → Large buy (0.15 WLD)
- 5% profit target → Sells at 7.5% (adapts higher)

**Extreme Market (Extreme Volatility):**
- 90% dip → Extreme buy (0.2 WLD)
- 5% profit target → Sells at 12.5% (much higher)

### **🛡️ Beginner Protection:**
- **Never buys above your average price**
- **Automatic stop-loss at 15%**
- **Maximum trade size limited to 0.1 WLD**
- **Conservative gas settings to save fees**
